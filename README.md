# CryptoClustering

In the following challenge we used Unsupervised learning to predict cryptocurrencies' price changing behaviour in 24hour or 7 days. We first imported the data and got some statical value. Next we scaled the numerical data, from here we selected the best value for K based on the inertia. Then we produced clusters. 
After we used the PCA method to optimize clusters using a PCA component of 3. We then got the best K value with the PCA data and produced cluster. Then we compared the original scaled data to the PCA data.
